    "# Python Wrapper or RESTful\n",
    "Many data provides offer a library of methods or functions that wrap the API in python (or other languages), this is often called a \"Client\" or \"Wrapper\". These wrapper handle many repetative tasks, like authentication or pagnination that can be complicated to handle directly with the API. The Public Cloud providers (GCP, AWS, Azure, etc.) offer very will documented and optimized libraries [Google Cloud Python Client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client).\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining a multi-language library that acts as middle-ware to APIs is a labor intensive undertaking, while the big tech giants have the resources to keep these up-to-date many time these library fall behind or may not be performative. In many other cases the API that needs to be accessed might not have a python client and is only available using HTTP methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common implimentation of HTTP methods are RESTful APIs. RESTful APIs are enhanced HTTP methods that has base usablity across methods and implimentation. Caching, throttling and secruity are built-in to these methods. Depending on the design of an API those features will have differing importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious question, which way should be used to access API data? The answer- it depends. It depends what methods are available? How performative is the client? How stable are the APIs or clients?"

    "`https://httpbin.org/get?key1=value1&key2=value2`<br>\n",

    "### Response Objects\n",
    "The response object contain similar information to the request, but is created by the server and is an answer to the request that was made.\n",

    "**Status Code**: A code that indicates the resolution of the request, `200` is the accepted code, other numeric codes represent other resolutions\n",
